Our goal is to bring artificial intelligence and cybersecurity together. To do that, we need to explore what's happening in AI and what's happening in cybersecurity, and where the two intersect and collide. We're also working to understand how we solve problems in these areas, what that looks like, and how Canada can and will participate.

With that in mind, we're pleased to announce our speaker and the agenda for our next meeting!

## Agenda

1. Welcome and introductions
1. Demo of GenAI and security in action
1. Speaker #1 - Details to come
1. Speaker #2 - Details to come
1. Lightning talks and demos - Please let us know if you have anything to show
1. Networking and drinks

## Lightning Talks and Demos

Please reach out to us if you'd like to present at the meetup. We are looking for people to talk about what they are working on, what they are building and learning, and are open to any level of experience and technical depth. Whether you are a beginner or an expert, we want to hear from you! We're all just out here building and learning.

## See You There!

Thanks, and we look forward to seeing you there!
