Our goal is to bring artificial intelligence and cybersecurity together. To do that, we need to explore what's happening in AI and what's happening in cybersecurity, and where the two intersect and collide. We're also working to understand how we solve problems in these areas, what that looks like, and how Canada can and will participate.

With that in mind, we're pleased to announce our speaker and the agenda for our next meeting!

## Agenda

*  **Welcome and introductions**
*  **Demo of GenAI and security in action**

**Speaker #1: Jai Mansukhani**

Talk Title: *Building AI Agents with Natural Language*

About Jai:

*"I’m Jai Mansukhani, co-founder of OpenSesame. My background in AI started with building a previous edtech company and the largest an association at uoft. Found that building reliable agents is super hard for people who just want to deploy an agent quickly. This experience inspired me to create OpenSesame, where we focus on building AI agents with natural language. Our goal is to build the Shopify of Vertical AI agents"*

**Speaker #2: Akash Shetty**

Talk Title: *Revolutionizing Document Analysis and Research with Multi-Agent Systems*

Abstract:

*"In a world drowning in data, extracting actionable insights from vast collections of documents is a game-changer. In this talk, you’ll discover how Publicus leverages multi-agent systems to transform document analysis and research. We’ll dive into the architecture of AI-powered agents that collaborate to automate data processing, streamline complex research tasks, and provide real-time updates on critical changes. Learn how advanced AI techniques, like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and multi-agent coordination, can dramatically enhance efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making.*

*"Whether you’re dealing with regulations, legal data, or extensive research materials, this session will equip you with the knowledge to build and implement multi-agent systems that intelligently navigate and analyze large datasets. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to unlock new capabilities and revolutionize your approach to document research!"*
