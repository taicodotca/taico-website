The TAICO team is proud to announce our first meetup. Much thanks to Hays for hosting!

Our goal is to bring artificial intelligence and cybersecurity together. To do that, we need to explore what's happening in AI and what's happening in cybersecurity, and where the two intersect and collide. We're also working to understand how we solve problems in these areas, what that looks like, and how Canada can and will participate.

With that in mind, we're pleased to announce our speakers and the agenda for our first meeting!

**Agenda**

1. Speaker: Sahand Sojoodi - Tech Entrepreneur, Managing Director @ Integral Consulting
2. Speaker: Mark Xiang, DevSecOps @ Cohere
3. Group discussion led by the TAICO team: Most software companies are built to solve really big problems with big markets, but what about all the other problems? Topics: Micro-SaaS, Building with AI, & Entrepreneurship in Canada

Come with your big ideas, your questions, and let us know what you think about AI and cybersecurity in today's world.

Again--many thanks to Hays for providing the space and hosting, we couldn't do this without their help.

More information to come and see you all soon!
